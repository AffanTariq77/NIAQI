## 🔄 Navigation Flow

### Updated Routes
Added to `app/_layout.tsx`:
- `/memberships` → MembershipsScreen
- `/cart` → CartScreen
- `/membership-details` → MembershipDetailsScreen

### Navigation Paths

```
Home (tabs/index.tsx)
  ↓ (tap membership card)
Memberships (app/memberships.tsx)
  ↓ (tap "Start Now" button)
Cart (app/cart.tsx)
  ↓ (tap "Checkout" button)
Membership Details (app/membership-details.tsx)
```

### Integration with Existing Flow
- **Sign In** → Home (direct, no intermediate screens)
- **Sign Up** → Account Created → Home
- **Home** → Memberships → Cart → Membership Details

## 🎨 Design Consistency

### Gradients
All screens use the same gradient theme:
```javascript
colors={['#f8e7ef', '#e4ecff', '#ffffff']}
```

### Card Styling
- `borderRadius: 16`
- `shadowColor: '#000'`
- `shadowOpacity: 0.1`
- `shadowRadius: 8`
- `elevation: 3` (Android)

### Color Palette
- Primary text: `#333333`
- Secondary text: `#666666`
- Tertiary text: `#999999`
- Primary buttons: `#007BFF`
- Price (active): `#4299E1`
- Price (old): `#999999` with strikethrough

### Typography
- Headings: 18px, 600 weight
- Body text: 14-16px, regular weight
- Button text: 16px, 600 weight

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### State Management
- Uses React hooks (`useState`) for local state
- Expandable cards controlled by `expandedCard` state
- User info from `useAuth` context

### Components Used
- `GradientBackground` - Consistent backgrounds
- `PrimaryButton` - Styled action buttons
- `SafeAreaView` - Safe area handling
- `ScrollView` - Scrollable content
- `LinearGradient` - For feature cards
- `Ionicons` - For navigation and UI icons
- `FontAwesome` - For star ratings

### Mock Data
Currently using hardcoded data:
- 3 membership options (all identical for now)
- Fixed pricing: $199 / $299
- 8 features (4 unlocked, 4 locked)
- Cart with single item

## ✅ Features Implemented

- ✅ Memberships screen with expandable cards
- ✅ Cart screen with item and summary
- ✅ Membership details with feature grid
- ✅ Proper navigation between all screens
